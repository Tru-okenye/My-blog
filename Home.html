        Its just you and your laptop trying to figure out how you will become that developer who everyone is looking
        upto<br>
        Easy! You dont need to think hard, schedule your time properly. ensure that everyday you speaker atleast four
        hours for you codes<br>
        Wake up early, it so peaceful and no distractions at all<br>
        Everything will start falling in place, just let go everything and start feeling your codes.<br>
        Do more research and consult your friends who are good at what you are tackling<br>
        Always never blindly copy people's codes, you should understand everthing you code<br>
        I love reading peoples tweets and blogs and it makes me learn alot, there is so much in programming <br>
        and you will never get to know everything. Just pick a language and stick to it, learn more about it daily<br>
        Always believe in yourself because damn nobody knows where you have from.<br>
        That moment you had zero ideas to a point where you could display`Hello World`!.<br>
        <b>YOU ARE A GENIOUS!
