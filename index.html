    <p>who is waiting for me to give lines of motivation?
        I dont think if you are at the right page since am not a motivational speaker! haha just kidding.<br>
        Becoming that developer you always see in your dreams, you first need to enjoy coding.<br>
        Seeing your lines of code no matter how small the problem you solved is should be the best feeling.<br>
        Well as for me i am not a perfect developer but putting more strategies is gonna help me reach their.<br>
        Everyday make sure you grasp a new concept and practice it. code and code and code!<br>
        Learn by yourself from sites or tutorials.<br>
        Being taught by someone else doesnt seem like a good idea to me since they give shallow content so research
        by
        your own<br>
        Its intresting guys i tell you! if you are a begginer remember everyone was there and loosing hope will make
        you
        regret in the near future.<br>
        What if you never lost hope! i have learnt to be patient, <br>
        sometimes you feel like its not working out but then you remember you aint a looser!<br>
        I can recommend for you a few sites which have helped me like; <a href="freecodecamp.com">freecodecamp</a><br>
        <a href="w3school.com">w3school</a> and many more other useful sites you have been recommended by your
        friends<br>
        I hope this helped. thank you!
